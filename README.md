Body Mass Index Calculator

BMI stands for body mass index. It is a measure that uses your height and weight to work out if your weight is healthy. It is calculated by dividing your weight in kilograms by your height in meters squared. For example, if you weigh 70 kg and are 1.75 m tall, your BMI is:

BMI = 70 / (1.75 ** 2) = 22.86
A high BMI can indicate high body fatness, but it does not measure body fat directly. BMI can also vary depending on age, sex, ethnicity and muscle mass. Therefore, it is not a perfect indicator of health or obesity. The World Health Organization (WHO) has defined the following BMI categories for adults2:

Underweight: less than 18.5
Normal weight: 18.5 to 24.9
Overweight: 25 to 29.9
Obese: 30 or more
